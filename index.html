<h3>How To Play</h3>

<p>As you play Glide, You will notice quite a few different things in the game. This wiki page attempts to explain as much as possible. Below you can read more about bomb spawning, enemy spawning, different types of drops and weapons, game objectives, sounds, menus, Heads Up Display and much more.</p>

<h4>Objective</h4>

<p>Your objective, is to destroy all of the bombs that spawn before they reach the bottom of the screen. There will be one bomb per level, and once you destroy the last bomb (At the end of level 10), you win the game.</p>

<h4>Drops</h4>

<p>There are several types of drops you can get in the game, below, you will see a detailed description of each. Drop rarity is based on a 2:1 randomized ratio. </p>

<ul>

<li>
<p><img src="images/shield.png" alt="Shield"><strong>Shield</strong></p>

<p>Shield will give you a glowing edge around your craft. It will allow you to go about unharmed by enemy bullets and collisions. When you collide with an enemy, they will die, and you will not lose any health. These collisions will also destroy a bomb in a single hit. The Shield Powerup will last 16 seconds.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="images/plasma_player.png" alt="Plasma Cannon (Player)"><strong>Plasma Cannon</strong> <img src="images/plasma_enemy.png" alt="Plasma Cannon (Enemy)"></p>

<p>The Plasma Cannon is your main weapon. It will destroy most enemies in a single burst, and is the base weapons for the Beam Powerup. Enemies can also use this weapon, However they can not use the Beam Powerup. Gold enemies will fire twice as often as red, and Bombs will not fire at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="images/mdb_pickup.png" alt="MDB"><strong>MDB</strong></p>

<p>The MDB is a limited weapon that you can only carry 5 of at a time. When fired, It will shoot a bomb in every direction outward from your current player location. The bombs it fires, will destroy anything in one hit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="images/bomb.png" alt="Bomb"><strong>Bombs</strong></p>

<p>Bombs are not weapons that the player can use. They are enemy weapons, that will decide weather you win or lose the game. There are 10 bombs per game. 1 per level. If a player collides with a bomb, they will immediately die. If the bomb reaches the bottom of the screen (Your Mother Ship) you will lose the game. The main objective of this game is to destroy all 10 of these bombs, before the enemies destroy you.</p>
</li>

<p><img src="images/sweeper.png" alt="Bomb"><strong>Sweeper-Detonator</strong></p>

<p>Sweeper-Detonators are weapons that will spread accross the level and destroy everything in their path. They are the rarest drop, and you can only carry two. They, however, are the most powerful player used weapon in the game.</p>
